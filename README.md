# WebApp URL Launcher

Welcome to the WebApp URL Launcher! This tool is a fork of the original `webapp.exe` application, extended to allow launching with a specified URL directly from the command line.

## Features

- Generate a unique configuration for each launch
- Automatically create and clean up necessary files and directories
- Launch the `webapp.exe` with a custom URL

## Usage

1. Ensure `webapp.exe` is in the same directory as this tool.
2. Run the tool with the desired URL as a parameter.
3. The tool will handle the rest, including launching the web application and cleaning up afterward.

## Example

``
python new_webapp.py -url "file:///C:/path/to/your/file.html"
``
